And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God." After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and was baptizing. John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized (for John had not yet been put in prison). Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purification.<

Title: American Standard Version
Copyright: Public Domain
Description: The ASV has long been regarded by many scholars as the most literal English translation since the King James Version—maybe the most literal translation ever. This has made the translation very popular for careful English Bible study, but not for ease of reading. While the KJV was translated entirely from 'western manuscripts', the ASV 1901 was influenced also by the older 'eastern manuscripts' that form the basis for most of our modern English translations. Because the ASV 1901 is very difficult to find in print, Logos is pleased to be able to preserve and distribute this significant work. This is an excellent choice for comparative English study.
